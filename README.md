This board is a direct replacement controller for the classic IBM Model M keyboards.<br>
Old mechanical keyboards are making a comeback among enthusiasts and programmers and gaining value.<br>
Unfortunately, modern computers no longer have DIN or PS2 ports, so there’s no simple way to connect a 40-year-old hardware to a brand-new laptop.<br>
By replacing the legacy electronics inside the keyboard, it’s possible to revive a “piece of history” and even add modern functions like USB connectivity and remappable characters. The original PCB can be preserved to revert the keyboard to its original state.<br>

The "Model H Remix" is designed to fit and work with standard 101/102 keys keyboards.<br>
